# Installation

Run `bundle install` to install dependencies.

# Testing

Run the command `rspec` to run all tests.

# Requirements

Complete all tests one by one:

- Test 1: `rspec spec/test_1_spec.rb`
- Test 2: `rspec spec/test_2_spec.rb`
- Test 3: `rspec spec/test_3_spec.rb`

...and so on, for each test file.
This README.md provides guidance for setting up a Ruby project, installing dependencies via Bundler, running tests using
RSpec, and completing specific tests individually using their corresponding RSpec test files. Adjust the commands and
filenames based on your project's structure and testing framework.
